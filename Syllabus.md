## Description

For the Spring 2021 semester iteration, students in _Techniques of Interactive Media Design_ will learn how to work as part of an Art & Media Design Studio with the goal of conceiving, designing, creating, building, and presenting a large-scale, interactive art installation. 

Through this process students will explore the theory and technique of interactive art & media design.

This course will focus on the creation of a single, large artwork. In addition this course will include a mix of readings, videos, responses, and discussion.

## Objectives & Student Learning Outcomes

<!-- Need to rework these according to UMT's updated SLO language suggestions -->

Through this course, students are expected to;

- Build their vocabulary and understanding about interactive theory and interactive art that began in MART340.
- Become versed in the tools and techniques available for the creation of interactive art systems.
- Utilize and implement an intentional system architecture following current practices and theory of interactive systems.
- Practice critiquing art-based interactive systems.
- Develop skills and experience in team work towards the creation of a large project.

This course will conclude with a public presentation of the final interactive artwork. 

## Course Modality/Format

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Department of Media Arts has moved all classes to online/asynchronous, remote/synchronous, or blended for the 2020/21 academic year. As a result, this course will be delivered via a _blended & synchronous_ modality. This means, at the discretion of the instructor, this class will meet in person when appropriate and safe, or synchronously via zoom. Regardless, all students are may choose to participate remotely for the duration of the semester.

#### Course Recording

This serves as an explicit declaration that all courses meetings may be recorded. These will then be available for further study at a later time by students of the course.


## Course Websites

- Moodle -- Moodle will serve as a secure location for you to submit homework, receive feedback, and engage in discussion forums with your colleagues.
- [Course GitHub Repo - https://github.com/Montana-Media-Arts/interactive-design-sp21](https://github.com/Montana-Media-Arts/interactive-design-sp21) (This git repository holds code examples, the syllabus, and all digital material related to the course.)




## Pre-Requisites

This course does have a pre-requirement that you have successfully taken _Principles of Interactive Media (Interactive Art 1) - MART 340_. For those of you who requested overrides into the course or waving of this requirement, you may need to spend extra time on the technical and/or theoretical aspects of this course to stay caught-up.

It is also suggested that you have taken Creative Coding 1 & 2 (MART 120/220), as well as Web Development and Web Technologies (MART 341/441).

Additionally, you are expected to utilize your previous expertise in coding, content creation, story telling, art, sculpture, sound, music, dance, etc. towards the projects presented in the course.


## Books, Supplies, & Technology

There are no required texts that you must purchase for this course. All readings will be available to you through web links, The class Moodle, the UMT library access to journal databases, or the class Slack channel.

### Other Supplies

You will need access to a computer capable of running modern sound and visual processing languages, digital audio workstations (DAWs), editing software, and a development environment. This computer should also be capable of real-time signal processing through analog inputs and outputs (i.e., using an audio interface or web cam).  

We will primarily leverage departmental resources to create the project for this course.



# Policies

## Course Evaluation

Student work and progress will be assessed through;

- In-class discussions and critiques
    - You are expected to engage with class discussions about technical and artistic issues.
    - You are expected to engage with class discussions about outside readings and listenings. This will include written responses that you must submit.
    - You are expected to engage in class critique days of the two projects.
- Project
	- There will be one large project that we will create collaboratively. You will be assigned aspects of this project and assessed based on your contributions in these areas.

## Plagiarism and Cheating Policy

Students are expected to adhere to academic conduct policies of the University of Montana as explained in Section V of your [University of Montana Student Conduct Code](http://www.umt.edu/student-affairs/dean-of-students/Student%20Conduct%20Code%20-%20FINAL%20-%208-24-18.pdf):  “Academic misconduct is subject to an academic penalty by the course instructor and/or a disciplinary sanction by the University.  Academic misconduct is defined as all forms of academic dishonesty, including but not limited to:  (1) plagiarism, (2) misconduct during an examination or academic exercise, (3) unauthorized possession of examination or other course materials, (4) tampering with course materials, (5) submitting false information, (6) submitting work previously presented in another course, (7) improperly influencing conduct, (8) substituting, or arranging substitution, for another student during an examination or other academic exercise, (9) facilitating academic dishonesty, and (10) Altering transcripts, grades, examinations, or other academically related documents.”

Dishonesty will not be tolerated in this course. This includes, but is not limited to, cheating on tests, cheating on assignments, fabricating information or citations, having unauthorized possession of examinations, submitting work of another person or work previously used, or tampering with the academic work of other students.

Plagiarism is the presentation of the work of another without acknowledgement. As defined by the [University of Montana’s Student Conduct Code](http://www.umt.edu/vpsa/policies/default.php), plagiarism is “Representing another person's words, ideas, data, or materials as one's own.”  Students may use information and ideas expressed by others, but this use must be identified by appropriate referencing.

Students who cheat or plagiarize will receive academic sanctions, which may include an “F” grade on the assignment, examination, and/or in the course. Students will also be reported to the Dean of Students for possible further disciplinary action.

#### Using Code or Media Found Elsewhere

It is easy to find code and media (i.e. videos, sounds, images, etc.) online. If you use code or media from elsewhere (which you will at times), I expect you to cite the work and author.

If you use found code, you are expected to comment each line, as to what each line does programmatically. _Do not_ summarize several lines of code from a high level (i.e., TV Guide). I expect you to comment each line on a granular level. In addition, in these cases, I am also looking for significant modification of the code, for you to enact your own ideas and to experiment heavily. Significant modification means beyond variable name and value changes. It is bending these concepts to your idea, especially graphically. It is not a copy and paste job. Also, never more than 40% of your code may be supplied from elsewhere. Period. If you use code from online, whether for inspiration, modification or reference, I expect to see a link in your comments from where you got the code and who wrote it. Otherwise it will be considered as plagiarism, and you will fail the assignment. The code must have a reference, along with URL and be commented out LINE BY LINE.

If you use found media, *YOU* are responsible to ensure it is used according to fair-use guidelines. The pieces you make in this course are intended to be portfolio-quality works. Therefore, you should not utilize found media with restrictive use guidelines or licenses. You can read more about various licenses at;

- [opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/legal/)
- [choosealicense](https://choosealicense.com)
- [GNU Licenses](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.en.html)
- [Creative Commons Licenses](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/)
- [opensource.org](https://opensource.org/licenses)

For found media, you are also expected to cite the media in your documentation for the project.



## Students with Disabilities

The University of Montana assures equal access to instruction through collaboration between students with disabilities, instructors, and Disability Services for Students. Students with disabilities are encouraged to plan ahead and can contact [Disability Services for Students (DSS)](http://www.umt.edu/dss/). If you think you may have a disability adversely affecting your academic performance, and you have not already registered with Disability Services, please contact Disability Services in Lommasson Center 154, or call (406)243-2243. I will work with you and Disability Services to provide an appropriate modification.




## Changes to the Course

I reserve the right to change the intended content of this course throughout the semester. This may be done to adjust for the speed of the class, to better meet educational goals, or to account for changes in technology.
